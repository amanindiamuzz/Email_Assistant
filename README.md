<h1>Email Assistant</h1>
  Are you the one who have to deal with alot of emails and have to send certificates.
  Well, I can feel you pain of creating certificates indivisally and sending over mail.
  
  But not again you have to face the same issue beacuse here I am bringing a Email assistant project to you.
  
  <h2> what are the things needed</h2>
  You just needed a python enviroment and have to import some liabraries.
  The liabraries which you have to import are:<br>
  <code> Pandas </code><br>
  <code> numpy </code><br>
  and job done.
  
  Fork this project, put the certificate template in the same folder and at the place of mail, put your mail id.
  Make sure that your mail have no OTP verification thing.
